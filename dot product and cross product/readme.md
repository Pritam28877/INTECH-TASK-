# Cross Product in Three-Dimensional Space

## Overview
The cross product is a fundamental operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space. It results in a vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors. This operation is denoted by **a √ó b**, and its resultant vector is perpendicular to vectors **a** and **b**. The cross product is also known as the vector product.

## Calculation
The cross product of two vectors, **A** and **B**, is calculated using the Right-hand Rule. The result, denoted as **A √ó B**, is a vector.

## Properties and Usage
- **Perpendicularity**: The resultant vector is perpendicular to both input vectors.
- **Denotation**: The cross product is denoted as **A √ó B**.
- **Application**: It is often used to determine a vector that is perpendicular to the plane formed by two input vectors.
- **Three Dimensions**: The cross product occurs in three-dimensional space.
  
## Mathematical Representation
The vector product of two vectors **A = (a1, a2, a3)** and **B = (b1, b2, b3)** is given by:

\[A √ó B = \left| \begin{matrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ a1 & a2 & a3 \\ b1 & b2 & b3 \end{matrix} \right|\]

Here, \(\hat{i}\), \(\hat{j}\), and \(\hat{k}\) are unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.
