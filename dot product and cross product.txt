Cross product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space.
 It results in a vector that is perpendicular to both vectors. The Vector product of two vectors, a and b,
 is denoted by a × b. Its resultant vector is perpendicular to a and b. Vector products are also called cross
 products.
 Cross product of two vectors will give the resultant a vector and calculated using the Right-hand Rule.

The vector product or cross product of two vectors A and B is denoted by A × B,
and its resultant vector is perpendicular to the vectors A and B.
The cross product is mostly used to determine the vector,
which is perpendicular to the plane surface spanned by two vectors,
whereas the dot product is used to find the angle between two vectors or the length of the vector.
The cross product of two vectors, say A × B, is equal to another vector at right angles to both, 
and it happens in the three dimensions.
