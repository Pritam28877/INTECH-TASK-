# HashMap Overview

## Overview
A HashMap is a data structure that facilitates the storage of key-value pairs for efficient retrieval. The term "hash" in HashMap refers to the hashing technique used within the structure. Hashing involves converting a large input (e.g., a string) into a smaller representation that still uniquely represents the original input. This process is achieved through a hash function.

## Hash Function
The crucial component in implementing a HashMap is the hash function. The hash function is responsible for mapping each key to its corresponding value. It takes the key as input and produces an index (or hash code) where the associated value can be stored or retrieved.

## Implementation Example (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Creating an array to simulate a HashMap
    array<int, 100> intArray;

    // Populating the array with values
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        intArray[i] = i;
    }

    // Accessing and printing values from the "HashMap"
    for (const auto &i : intArray) {
        cout << i << ' ';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, an array is used to simulate a basic HashMap. The keys are represented by array indices, and the values are stored at those indices. In a real HashMap, the hash function would determine the index based on the key.
